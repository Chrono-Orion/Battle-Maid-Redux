# Battle Maid Redux

This is an attempted translation of the Battle Maid mod for C:DDA with some minor nerfs to the martial arts.
This uses the same IDs as the original mod, so DO NOT use this mod at the same time with the original.

My Japanese isn't exactly the greatest, so I got creative with some of the descriptions and flexed my 200 billion creative IQ muscle on a couple others and wrote my own thing, while still staying true to the mod.

WHAT THE MOD ADDS:
- 4 professions
- A new martial art
- Some weapons and armor
- Some new items
- Maid point system used to power up gear from this mod
- Maid pets
- Probably something else that I've forgotten.
I spent over nine hours translating and porting this and didn't take a single break, go easy on me.

CREDITS:
I have no idea who made the original mod, but whoever you are and whereever you are, thank you.
ChestHole, for inspiring me to do this thanks to his... attempt at porting the mod into English. (sorry)

Let me know if there are issues with it.
